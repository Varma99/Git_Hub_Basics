Repository : A storage house of all the files that make up a project
README : A must have file in every repository which makes the 
reader's mind comfortable way before jumping to the project / code .
Commit : Save 
And when you commit , you will have something called 'hash'
and 'hash' is the unique identifier(number) to your file and we 
will call it a hash key .
Branch : It allows you to create a new file based on the exisiting file over a seperate path .
Master is the main branch / Linear Branch , and when you create you a new branch 
it means that your branch is no longer part of the master/Linear Branch .
